  <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
  <div class="terms">
    <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) constitute a binding legal agreement governing your access to and use of all services (“Services”) provided by the Management Team. By accessing, engaging with, or participating in any aspect of these Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and voluntarily agreed to be bound by every guideline, requirement, and provision set forth herein. If you do not accept or agree to these Terms in their entirety, you are required to immediately discontinue all use of the Services.</p>

    <h3>General Principles & Conduct Requirements</h3>
    <p>The purpose of these Terms is to maintain an orderly, safe, respectful, and professionally structured environment for all interactions—particularly those involving fan engagement and meet-and-greet activities. Users of the Services are expected to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the standards established by Management. This includes strict adherence to all procedural guidelines, verification processes, communication protocols, and behavioral expectations mandated by the organization.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that meet-and-greet sessions cannot be approached informally or casually, and that the celebrity involved maintains a relationship with their fanbase built on mutual respect, emotional boundaries, and appropriate conduct. Any form of disruptive behavior, misconduct, disrespectful communication, aggression, or misunderstanding that interferes with the integrity of the Service is strictly prohibited. The Management Team reserves full authority to deny access, suspend engagement, or permanently restrict participation from any individual who fails to meet these standards.</p>

    <h3>Eligibility to Participate</h3>
    <p>Participation in any fan engagement activities, including meet-and-greet events, is contingent upon satisfying the eligibility requirements established by Management. Users must meet the minimum age requirement of eighteen (18) years or obtain verified parental or legal guardian consent. Participants must complete all verification steps, comply with identity and access checks, and remain free from previous violations or disciplinary restrictions. Failure to meet any eligibility requirement automatically disqualifies the individual from participating.</p>
    <p>The Management Team retains the sole discretion to determine eligibility, approve or deny access, and enforce restrictions where necessary to ensure the safety, orderliness, and proper functioning of the Services.</p>

    <h3>Access Credentials & Required Procedures</h3>
    <p>To obtain authorization for participation in any meet-and-greet session, users must first acquire an official Access Credential issued by Management. This credential is granted only upon completion of all required steps, including identity validation, direct communication with the Management Team, and full payment of all associated fees. Access Credentials cannot be transferred, shared, or used in any manner inconsistent with the guidelines set forth.</p>
    <p>Management may request further information or documentation at any time to confirm eligibility or verify compliance. Any failure or refusal to provide such information may result in immediate denial or revocation of access.</p>

    <h3>Behavioral Obligations & Enforcement Authority</h3>
    <p>All participants must uphold respectful, orderly, and cooperative behavior throughout every interaction associated with the Services. Any conduct deemed aggressive, inappropriate, disruptive, hostile, or violative of public safety or the comfort of others will result in immediate removal from the premises or digital environment. Management reserves the right to impose temporary or permanent bans, revoke Access Credentials, or take any corrective action it considers necessary to preserve safety and integrity.</p>
    <p>These enforcement measures may be applied without prior notice and at Management’s exclusive discretion.</p>

    <h3>Health & Safety Protocols</h3>
    <p>For extended meet-and-greet sessions or specialized engagements requiring additional time or physical proximity, health and safety assessments may be conducted. Such procedures are mandatory and may include precautionary checks, compliance confirmations, or precautionary assessments deemed necessary by Management. Participation may be denied if any health or safety concern is identified that could compromise the well-being of the celebrity, the participant, or the surrounding environment.</p>
    <p>Health protections are a core component of the Service’s operational structure. <strong>Health is Wealth.</strong></p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>By utilizing the Services, you consent to the collection, use, processing, and retention of your personal information for administrative, security, and operational purposes. Information collected may include identification details, communication data, and any other information reasonably necessary to confirm eligibility or facilitate the Service.</p>
    <p>Management is committed to safeguarding user privacy and will not sell, unlawfully disclose, or exploit personal information for unauthorized purposes. However, information may be shared when legally required or when necessary for security, fraud prevention, or operational enforcement. Users may request updates or corrections to their personal data by contacting Management directly. Data retention will follow internal protocols consistent with professional privacy standards.</p>

    <h3>Payments & Refund Regulations</h3>
    <p>All payments associated with Access Credentials, scheduling arrangements, or service upgrades must be completed in full before any participation or confirmation is granted. Fee structures may vary based on duration, session type, or individual circumstances related to the engagement.</p>
    <p>Payments are generally non-refundable. Refunds may be considered only under limited circumstances, including cancellation initiated by Management, administrative error, or health-related disqualification determined solely by Management. Submission of a refund request does not guarantee approval; all determinations regarding refunds remain at Management’s sole and final discretion.</p>

    <h3>Authority to Modify Terms</h3>
    <p>Management reserves the unrestricted right to revise, modify, or update these Terms at any time and without prior notice. Continued use of the Services following any amendments constitutes full acceptance of all revised terms.</p>

    <h3>Final Acknowledgment</h3>
    <p>By participating in or accessing any part of the Service, you affirm your understanding of and agreement to all provisions contained herein.</p>
